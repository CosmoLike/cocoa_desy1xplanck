DESY1 x Planck with COCOA

This project perform the 6x2pt joint-likelihood analyses in **mix space**, i.e. the 5x2pt twopcfs are measured in real space and the CMB lensing twopcf is measured in Fourier space 

Note: the CMB lensing reconstruction noise file is in the format of "ell C_ell^{dd}". To translate to C^{kk}_ell, need to multiply ell(ell+1)/4
